## Goals

The goal of this workshop session is to understand how to:

- implement a peer discovery service using [UDP multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast).
- keep track of discovered peers.
- broadcast messages to discovered peers.
- implement a basic UDP server to handle incoming messages from discovered peers.
- interact with an existing terminal ui instance to display incoming messages and possibly, `INFO` messages about the application state.

## Advices

Use the code in the directory `start` as scaffold. *Comments are placed to guide you through so don't feel worried ^_^*

You can refer to the code in the directory `final` as reference if you ever get stuck ;)
